        <h2 class="section-title">Career</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Lionel Messis football career is one of the most remarkable stories in the history of sports. Born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Argentina, Messi showed exceptional talent from a very young age. He joined Newell's Old Boys when he was just six years old and quickly became known for his unbelievable dribbling, close ball control, and natural ability to score goals. Even as a child, he was scoring over 500 goals in youth competitions, which made him stand out as a unique talent. However, Messi faced a major challenge early in life — a growth hormone deficiency. His family struggled with the cost of treatment, but everything changed when FC Barcelona recognized his potential. At the age of 13, Messi and his family moved to Spain after Barcelona offered to cover his medical treatment and bring him into the club's famous academy, La Masia. This move marked the beginning of a legendary journey. Messi progressed rapidly through Barcelonas youth system.
            Coaches were stunned by his speed, vision, and ability to take on multiple defenders. In 2004, at the age of 17, he made his official first-team debut for FC Barcelona. From that moment, Messi became a central figure in the club's success. Under managers like Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, Messi developed into a complete footballer — a goal scorer, playmaker, and leader. During his 17 seasons with Barcelona, Messi won everything a player could dream of. He helped the club secure 10 La Liga titles, 7 Copa del Rey trophies, and 4 UEFA Champions League titles. The partnership of Messi with players like Xavi, Iniesta, Neymar, and Suárez created some of the most dominant football teams in history. His playstyle — incredible dribbling, sharp passing, magical free-kicks, and unmatched agility — turned him into a global icon.
            Individually, Messi broke countless records. He became Barcelonas all-time top scorer, scored 91 goals in a single year (2012), and won multiple Ballon d'Or awards, more than any player in the world. His rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo defined an entire era of football, pushing both players to extraordinary levels. In 2021, due to financial complications at Barcelona, the club could not renew Messis contract. With great emotion and sadness, Messi announced his departure and later joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Even in a new league, he continued to show his quality, contributing goals, assists, and leadership on the field. In 2023, Messi made another stunning move by joining Inter Miami in the Major League Soccer (MLS). His arrival transformed the popularity of the league globally. Messi quickly helped Miami win the Leagues Cup, the club's first-ever trophy, proving that even late in his career, his influence remains unmatched
            On the international stage, Messis journey is equally inspiring. After years of heartbreak in finals, he finally lifted his first major trophy with Argentina by winning the Copa América in 2021. The ultimate moment of his career came in 2022, when he led Argentina to victory at the FIFA World Cup, delivering one of the greatest performances in the tournament's history. This achievement cemented Messis legacy as one of the greatest footballers of all time, admired for both his skill and humility.
            Today, Lionel Messis career continues to inspire millions. From a small boy in Rosario facing health challenges to a world champion and global superstar, his journey is a powerful example of talent, hard work, and belief.

        <h2 class="section-title">Club Career</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Lionel Messi’s club career is one of the greatest chapters in football history. His journey began in Rosario, Argentina, but the world truly discovered him after he joined FC Barcelona at the age of 13. Brought into the club’s youth academy, La Masia, Messi developed under some of the best coaches and quickly became a standout talent. His extraordinary dribbling, lightning acceleration, and natural playmaking ability made him a future star even before he reached the senior team.
            Messi made his first-team debut for Barcelona on 16 October 2004, at just 17 years old. It didn’t take long before he became a regular starter. In the 2005–06 season, Messi scored several crucial goals and started forming a dangerous attacking trio with Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto’o. His breakthrough performance came during the 2006–07 season, where he scored a memorable hat-trick against Real Madrid at just 19, announcing himself as one of the most gifted players in the world.
            Under Pep Guardiola, Messi reached an entirely new level. Playing as a “false nine,” he helped Barcelona dominate European football. The team achieved a historic treble in the 2008–09 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. Messi scored in the Champions League final and finished the season as the club’s top scorer. Over the next few years, he became the engine of Barcelona’s famous tiki-taka style, forming legendary partnerships with Xavi and Iniesta.
            Between 2009 and 2012, Messi played the best football of his career. In 2012, he set an unbelievable record by scoring 91 goals in a single calendar year, a milestone that shocked the football world. During his time at Barcelona, Messi helped the club win: 10 La Liga titles,7 Copa del Rey trophies,4 UEFA Champions League titles,3 FIFA Club World Cups,3 UEFA Super Cups,8 Spanish Super Cups.He also became Barcelona’s all-time top scorer, finishing with 672 goals in 778 matches, a record that is unlikely to be broken for decades.
            In 2014–2015, Messi formed one of the most dangerous attacking trios in football history: Messi – Suárez – Neymar (MSN). Together, they destroyed defenses across Europe, scoring over 120 goals in a single season and winning another treble. Messi remained the heart of the team, contributing not only goals but also assists, playmaking, and leadership.
            Unfortunately, in 2021, Barcelona’s financial crisis and La Liga’s regulations made it impossible for the club to renew Messi’s contract. In an emotional press conference, Messi announced his departure after spending 21 years at the club. He later signed with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).
            At PSG, Messi continued to shine, playing alongside stars like Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. He helped PSG win Ligue 1 titles, and contributed goals and assists, proving he could still perform at the highest level. However, his time in Paris was short-lived, and in 2023, Messi made a groundbreaking move to Inter Miami in Major League Soccer (MLS).
            In the United States, Messi instantly transformed Inter Miami. Within weeks, he led the team to win the Leagues Cup, the first trophy in the club’s history. His arrival brought worldwide attention to MLS, increased match attendance, and made Inter Miami one of the most followed football clubs in the world.
            Messi’s club career is extraordinary not only for his statistics but also for his loyalty, sportsmanship, and unmatched influence on the game. Across Barcelona, PSG, and Inter Miami, he has remained a symbol of excellence and a player who redefined what is possible on a football field.

        <h2 class="section-title">Player Profile</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Lionel Messi is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, admired not only for his extraordinary talent but also for his intelligence, humility, and longevity. His playing style is a rare combination of technical brilliance, creativity, and consistency. Messi is a natural left-footer with exceptional balance, allowing him to glide past defenders effortlessly. His low center of gravity, combined with quick changes of direction, makes him nearly impossible to dispossess.
            What makes Messi truly unique is his close ball control. Even at top speed, the ball seems glued to his feet. This ability, often called “gravity-defying dribbling,” allows him to navigate through tight spaces and beat multiple opponents with ease. He reads the game better than almost any player in history, making him both an elite goal scorer and an elite playmaker.
            Messi is known for his versatility in attack. Throughout his career, he has played as a winger, false nine, attacking midfielder, and deep playmaker. No matter the position, he adapts his playing style to the team’s needs. As a winger, he cuts inside to shoot with his left foot. As a false nine, he drops deep to build play and then makes sudden runs into the box. As a playmaker, he controls the tempo, creates chances, and sets up teammates with perfectly weighted passes.
            One of Messi’s greatest strengths is his ability to make quick decisions. With just one glance, he understands the positions of teammates, opponents, and the space available. This vision allows him to deliver stunning through-balls, switches of play, and assists that seem impossible to most players. Messi is also an excellent finisher, capable of scoring with finesse shots, powerful strikes, and even delicate chips over goalkeepers.
            His free-kick technique is another weapon in his arsenal. Messi has scored dozens of world-class free-kicks by curling the ball over walls with precision. Over the years, he has mastered placing the ball in the top corner from almost any angle.
            Despite being a global superstar, Messi is known for his humility and calm personality on and off the pitch. He rarely shows arrogance, never dives unnecessarily, and always prioritizes team play. This attitude has earned him respect from fans, teammates, and even rivals.
            Messi is also admired for his work ethic and ability to deliver consistently at the highest level. For nearly two decades, he has performed in elite competitions without major dips in form—something extremely rare in football history. Even as he has aged, Messi has evolved his game to remain effective, relying more on vision and playmaking while still producing goals and assists.
            His leadership style is quiet but powerful. Instead of shouting or demanding attention, Messi leads by example—through performance, discipline, and dedication. His teammates often say that his presence alone lifts the entire team’s confidence.
            Above all, Messi’s profile is defined by his love for the game. He plays with pure joy, creativity, and passion. Whether he is scoring a hat-trick in a Champions League match or assisting a teammate in MLS, Messi approaches every game with the same enthusiasm he had as a child.
            Today, Messi is not just a footballer—he is an icon whose influence goes beyond the sport. His style, personality, and achievements have inspired millions of young players around the world, and his legacy will remain unmatched for generations.

        <h2 class="section-title">Personal Life</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Lionel Messi’s personal life is often described as simple, humble, and deeply family-oriented, despite his status as one of the most famous athletes in the world. Born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Argentina, Messi grew up in a close and supportive household. His father, Jorge Messi, worked in a steel factory, and his mother, Celia Cuccittini, was employed in a magnet manufacturing workshop. Messi’s family played a crucial role in his development, both personally and professionally.
            Messi is the third of four children and has two older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and a younger sister, María Sol. His brothers often accompanied him to local matches and supported him in training sessions. Even today, his family remains involved in many aspects of his career and business decisions. Messi’s strong connection with his hometown is one of the reasons he continues to support youth football academies and charity programs in Rosario.
            One of the most important people in Messi’s life is his childhood sweetheart, Antonela Roccuzzo. The two first met when Messi was just five years old. Their families were close friends, and even after Messi moved to Spain as a teenager, they stayed connected. Their bond grew stronger over time, and the couple officially got together in the late 2000s. They married on 30 June 2017 in a beautiful ceremony in Rosario, attended by friends, family, and many football stars.
            Messi and Antonela have three sons: Thiago, born in 2012,Mateo, born in 2015,Ciro born in 2018
            Messi is known to be a loving and playful father. He often shares moments with his sons, whether it's playing football at home, attending training sessions, or celebrating victories together. Despite his fame, Messi prefers keeping his children’s lives private and focused on normal upbringing.
            Outside football, Messi leads a quiet and calm lifestyle. He avoids unnecessary controversy and prefers spending time at home with family. He enjoys playing video games, relaxing, listening to music, and traveling with his loved ones. Messi also maintains close friendships with former teammates like Luis Suárez, Neymar, and Xavi, often sharing vacations or family outings.
            Messi’s personal life is also marked by his strong commitment to charity and social causes. In 2007, he established the Leo Messi Foundation, which focuses on providing education, healthcare, and sports opportunities to children in need. The foundation has supported numerous hospitals, funded research, and helped build sports facilities around the world. Messi also works closely with UNICEF, serving as a Goodwill Ambassador since 2010.
            Throughout his life, Messi has remained grounded, respectful, and humble. His personality off the pitch contrasts with his superstar status on it. He values peace, privacy, and family time more than fame or luxury. These qualities have made him not just one of the greatest footballers ever, but also one of the most admired and beloved personalities in the world.
